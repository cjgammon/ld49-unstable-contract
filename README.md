# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

[tutorial](https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-create-layer-2-nfts-with-polygon-and-ipfs-aef998ff8ef2)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```



Compile contract
```
npx hardhat compile
```


Deploy contract to various networks
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contract.js --network matic
```

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contract.js --network rinkeby
```

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contract.js --network eth
```
